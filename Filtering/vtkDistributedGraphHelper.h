// .NAME vtkDistributedGraphHelper - helper for the vtkGraph class that allows the graph to be distributed across multiple memory spaces
//
// .SECTION Description
// A distributed graph helper can be attached to an empty vtkGraph
// object to turn the vtkGraph into a distributed graph, whose
// vertices and edges are distributed across several different
// processors. vtkDistributedGraphHelper is an abstract class. Use a
// subclass of vtkDistributedGraphHelper, such as
// vtkPBGLDistributedGraphHelper, to build distributed graphs.
//
// The distributed graph helper provides facilities used by vtkGraph
// to communicate with other processors that store other parts of the
// same distributed graph. The only user-level functionality provided
// by vtkDistributedGraphHelper involves this communication among
// processors. For example, the Synchronize() method provides a
// barrier that allows all processors to catch up to the same point in
// the code before any processor can leave that Synchronize()
// call. For example, one would call Synchronize() after adding many
// edges to a distributed graph, so that all processors can handle the
// addition of inter-processor edges and continue, after the
// Synchronize() call, with a consistent view of the distributed
// graph. For more information about manipulating (distributed)
// graphs, see the vtkGraph documentation.
