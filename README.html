<h1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" published by Prentice Hall
(ISBN 013199837-4). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994)
to a world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research 
communities.<p>

This is VTK version 3.2. For more information and a FAQ see our web page at
<A HREF="http://www.kitware.com">http://www.kitware.com</A><p>

<h1><A NAME="Documentation">Documentation</h1>

The ideal way to learn about the software is from the book it is designed to
support.  You should be able to get the book from any local bookstore or from
our web page. The web page also contains some html reference pages for the
objects in VTK as well as a FAQ.

<h1><A NAME="Installation">Installation</h1>

The Visualization Toolkit can be built on both Unix and PC 
(Windows 95/98/NT/2000) systems.<p>

<h3><A NAME="Unix">Unix Installation</h3>
The following instructions only apply to UNIX systems.  
The windows source distribution will be released in a different file.<p>

First we will give you the quick and dirty way to build VTK.
If you have OpenGL do the following:<p>

If you will be using C++ as your development language:
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd vtk
  4) ./configure
  5) read and edit user.make 
  6) make
</pre>

If you will be using tcl in addition to C++:
<pre>
  1) untar the src files
  2) untar the data files
  3) cd vtk
  4) obtain and build Tcl/Tk if you don't already have it
  5) ./configure --with-tcl 
  6) read and edit user.make
  7) make
</pre>

It is a very good idea to tell configure what C and C++ compilers
you will be using. This can avoid many build problems.
On most systems you can pass this information to configure in the 
following way:
<pre>
env CXX=/your/C++/compiler CC=/your/c/compiler ./configure
</pre>
otherwise you must set CXX and CC in your environment and then
run configure.<p>

This release also has Java and Python support. Use --with-java and/or
--with-python to generate the Java and Python language bindings.<p>a

If you do not have OpenGL, you will need to get and
compile Mesa, a wonderful free version of OpenGL. You will need to add
--with-mesa to your configure line. If you want to try building shared
libraries you can use the --with-shared option also.<p>

Now here is the slightly more detailed description of the build process.<p>

This software uses scripts generated by GNU autoconfigure to build itself.
There are a couple of options in building the software that you need to
decide on. First you need to decide if you are going to use the Mesa
rendering library developed by Brian Paul.  This is a software renderer that
VTK can use on Xwindows based workstations.  If your workstation doesn't
support OpenGL then you will need Mesa because you have
no other choice :-) If you want to build the VTK interpreter then you will
need to have Tcl8.2.3 and Tk8.2.3. <p>

Look to http://www.scriptics.com/ for information about getting
Tcl and Tk. To obtain a copy of Mesa, written by Brian Paul, you can
visit http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html.<p>

To build VTK in the distribution directory just type ./configure
You can specify  --with-tcl  and/or  --with-mesa  on the command line
if you would like to use those packages as well. Building VTK for multiple 
architectures will be discussed later.<p>

To build the VTK library and the tcl bindings and use mesa you would specify
<pre>
./configure --with-tcl --with-mesa
</pre>
The command:
<pre>
./configure --help
</pre>
gives some brief help for the command line arguments. If you are using gmake 
then you might want to consider the --srcdir option.<p>

The next step is to modify the user.make file.  If you are using Tcl/Tk you
must specify the full path to find the include files and libraries.  If you
are using Mesa you must do the same. You might also want to specify the
compiler flags.  We recommend compiling without debug information and with
optimizations. The debug information can quadruple the executable size.  If
you are going to be working with the C++ library you might want to look into
using shared libraries. (Use the configure option --with-shared.)<p>

Once this is done you can type make (or gmake if you have it) and it should
compile :-)<p>

If you are planning to build VTK for multiple architectures then you can
either make a copy of the entire VTK tree for each architecture and then
follow the instructions above. Or if you have gmake, you can have one copy of
the VTK tree and compile it in a different manner. Instead of running
configure from the VTK directory, create a new directory where you have some
free disk space (not in the VTK tree), a possible name would be
vtk-solaris. cd into this directory and then run configure similar to the
following example:
<pre>
ls /home/joe_user
    vtk vtk-solaris vtk-sgi

cd vtk-solaris
/home/joe_user/vtk/configure --with-tcl 
</pre>
This will create makefiles in the vtk-solaris directory.  Then you can run
gmake in vtk-solaris to compile VTK.  Repeate this process for each
architecture you wish to build.<p>

<h3><A NAME="PC">PC Installation</h3>
    The PC build process requires running a program to build
    dependencies and makefiles. Then you use the compiler make utility
    to compile as follows.
    <pre>
    1. Install vtk3.2 distribution by unzipping into the appropriate directory.

    2. Execute vtk\pcmaker\pcmaker.exe. This will pop-up a little
       GUI that allows you to tailor the build. It then starts
       building makefiles and dependencies. It will run for a couple
       minutes depending on your system. You'll have to tell pcamaker
       where you've placed your VTK source code, and where to build
       the object code and dll's (we'll call it "vtkbin").

    3. When pcmaker completes, start up a MS-DOS shell window
       and change directories to vtkbin\vtkdll. Then run 
       "nmake" (Microsoft compiler). This will compile for 
       a LONG time. When it's done, you'll have a vtkdll.dll 
       file in vtkbin\vtkdll\obj. You can then move this 
       file into the appropriate system directory 
       (on Win95: Windows\System; on NT: WinNT\system). 

    4. If you want to use Tcl/Tk on your PC, repeat step 3 above
       except work in directory vtkbin\vtktcl to create
       vtkbin\vtktcl\vtktcl.dll. Remember to move this file into your
       system area. (You'll also have to have Tcl (e.g., Wish)
       installed.)

    5. You can then link against vtkdll.dll (C++); or run Tcl
       (wish). If you're running Tcl, make sure you start by
       dynamically loading the vtktcl libraries with the command 
       "load vtktcl". 

    6. Enjoy.

We recommend a 300MByte minimum swap size or you'll have trouble
during the link phase.<p>

<h1><A NAME="Execution">Execution</h1>

Many of the examples require the data found in vtk20data.part1.tar.gz
through vtk20data.part4.tar.gz, plus the additional file
MissingData.tar.gz. (These files can be found at
ftp://public.kitware.com/pub/vtk, or in the vtkdata/ directory if this
document is part of the CD-ROM distribution.) 
The examples that require data look for it in ../../../vtkdata.
If you compiled with the --srcdir option you may need to create a
symbolic link to the data directory. <p>

To run the cc examples just type their name.  To run the tcl examples,
(assuming that you built the tcl stuff) type 
<pre>
../../../vtk/tcl/vtk mace.tcl 
</pre>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="Problems">Common Problems</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>I got a "warning: no configuration information is in tcl" from configure.
      This is correct and is supposed to happen.
  <li>Strange compile errors on Unix. Make sure that you specify the
      environment variables CXX and CC prior to running configure.
      (If you have already run configure, do a "make clean" to remove
      the cached configure information.)
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk include files. Make sure that you edit
      user.make to point to the correct location.
  <li>Errors on Tcl or Tk libraries. Make sure that you edit
      user.make to point to the correct location.
  <li>Link errors on Windows platforms. Make sure that the swap space is
      at least 300 MByte.
  </ul>

<HR>
<h1><A NAME="NewClass">Adding A New Class</h1>
<pre>
1) create the .cxx and .h file for the new class in one of the existing 
   directories. We recommend that you use the local/ directory.
2) edit Makefile.in for that directory and follow the instructions in
   there. You will need to add the class in only one place.
3) you will need to rerun configure (Unix) or pcmaker (Windows)
4) then make/gmake (Unix) or nmake (Windows).
