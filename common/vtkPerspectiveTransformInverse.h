// .NAME vtkPerspectiveTransformInverse - inverse of a perspective transform
// .SECTION Description
// The vtkPerspectiveTransformInverse is a helper class for 
// vtkPerspectiveTransform, you should avoid using it directly.   
// .SECTION see also
// vtkGeneralTransform

  // Description:
  // Set the transform that you want this to be an inverse of.

  // Description:
  // Get the cached copy of the forward transform (i.e. the inverse
  // of the Inverse transform).

  // Description:
  // Set this transform to the identity transform.  Warning: this modifies
  // the OriginalTransform.

  // Description:
  // Set this transform to its own inverse.  Warning: this modifies
  // the OriginalTransform.

  // Description:
  // Copy another transform into this one.  Warning: this modifies
  // the OriginalTransform.
  void DeepCopy(vtkGeneralTransform *transform);

  // Description:
  // Make another transform of the same type as the stored transform.

  // Description:
  // Return the modified time of this transform.

  // Description:
  // Update the inverse transform from the original.
