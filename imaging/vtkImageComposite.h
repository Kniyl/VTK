// .NAME vtkImageComposite - Composites multiple images.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageComposite Takes a number of inputs of structured points with
// pixel data and zbuffer data, and composites them into one.  The pixel
// data should be stored in point scalars, and the z buffer data should be 
// stored in a point field called ZBuffer.  This is the format produced by 
// vtkRendererSource.  

// .SECTION Notes
// Although this fitlter processes structured points, future plans are to
// have it produce vtkImageData and have it render select pieces of the 
// image. Also, this filter ignores alpha (for now).

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkRendererSource
