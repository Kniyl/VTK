// .NAME vtkImageTwoOutputFilter - Superclass of filters that have two outputs.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkImageTwoOutputFilter is a super class for filters that have one input
// and two outputs.  It still loops over the extra dimensions, but streaming
// has not been implemented for this superclass yet.  If you really need to 
// stream restrict (Input memory limit) a filter down stream.
// One restiction on multiple output filters is that the extent of all
// outputs have to be the same. (i.e. a filter can produce a small image
// on output number one, and a large image on output number two.
// This restriction is because the filter does not know which output
// a request is originating.  Also, the OutputScalarType must be the same
// for the two filters.  This is not an inherent limitation of the pipeline,
// but just an implementation descision.  I have also removed the ability
// to write your own update method.  Filters must be writen with
// Execute methods.
